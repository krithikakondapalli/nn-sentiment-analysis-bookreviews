# 📕 Book Review Sentiment Classification

## 📊 Data Set Used
The data set used is within this repository as bookReviewsData.csv

## ✏️ Problem Definition
- Predict whether a given book review expresses positive sentiment.
- Features in data set: "Review" column containing the actual review.
- Label: "Postive Review" containing a binary value
- ML Problem Type: Supervised Binary Classification

## 📈 Business Perspective
Throughout my Machine Learning Fundamentals Course at Cornell Tech, we were taught to consistently consider the business standpoints of our models. 
Classifying reviews based on sentiment is critical for companies and platforms that rely on user feedback. Some of many applications include:
- Negative feedback identification and addressal for customer satisfaction
- Recommendation systems of positively performing items
- Trend analysis through review mining

## 🚀 Final Notes
Overall, this project provided hands-on insight into the iterative and time-intensive nature of building a machine learning model. From data cleaning to model tuning, every step required thoughtful decisions and adjustments. 
It reinforced the importance of experimentation and careful evaluation in developing effective, real-world machine learning solutions.
Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my understanding of hyperparameter tuning techniques to better navigate the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. This includes fine-tuning aspects like learning rate schedules, batch size, and regularization methods.
Potential next steps include leveraging established word embeddings like GloVe for potentially better performance, and experimenting with alternative optimizers beyond Adam to enhance model training.
